![Tristina Wright]({{site.baseurl}}/media/400Image.png){:class="img-right"}
Tristina Wright is a blue-haired bisexual with anxiety and opinions. Sheâ€™s also possibly a mermaid, but no one can get confirmation. She fell in love with science fiction and fantasy at a young age and frequently got caught writing in class instead of paying attention. She enjoys worlds with monsters and kissing and monsters kissing. She married a nerd who can build computers and make the sun shine with his smile. Most days, she can be found drinking coffee from her favorite chipped mug and making up more stories for her wombfruit, who keep life exciting and unpredictable.  
  
Still trying to figure out the mermaid thing.
