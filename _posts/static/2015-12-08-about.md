![Tristina Wright]({{site.baseurl}}/media/400Image.png){:class="img-right"}
Tristina Wright is a rainbow-haired bisexual with anxiety and opinions. Sheâ€™s also possibly a mermaid, but no one can get confirmation. She fell in love with science fiction and fantasy at a young age and frequently got caught writing in class instead of paying attention.  
  
Her short fiction has been featured in places such as [Lightspeed Magazine](http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-siren-son/), [The Hanging Garden](https://hanginggardenstories.tumblr.com/tagged/THG-stories-by-Tristina-Wright), and various anthologies. She's also the author of _The Nightside Saga_ trilogy, which debuted in 2017. She's also a fierce advocate for both disability and queer rights. Her articles on both can be found [scattered about the internet](http://tristinawright.com/words/).  
  
She married a nerd who can build computers and make the sun shine with his smile. Most days, she can be found drinking coffee from her favorite chipped mug and making up tales with her wombfruit, who keep life exciting and unpredictable.  
  
Still trying to figure out the mermaid thing.
