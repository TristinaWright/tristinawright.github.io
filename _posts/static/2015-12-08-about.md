Tristina Wright is a blue-haired bisexual with anxiety and opinions. Sheâ€™s also possibly a mermaid, but no one can get confirmation. She writes YA SFF novels and short stories about queer teens who become heroes and monsters. She enjoys stories with monsters and kissing and monsters kissing. She married a nerd who can build her new computers and make the sun shine with his smile. Most days, she can be found drinking coffee from her favorite chipped mug and making up stories for her two wombfruit, who keep her life hectic and unpredictable.

Still trying to figure out the mermaid thing.
