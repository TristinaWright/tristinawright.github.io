title: My Statement

I'm not sure how to start this. I have so many words in my head, rolling around, clashing together, trying to make sense of everything I've observed over the past week and a half. I've been waiting to make a statement until things settled. Until investigations into the allegations made headway and/or concluded on this end. Until important decisions were made. 

And here we are. So, I should probably start at the beginning. 

**Apologies**

I have several apologies to make, but none nearly as important as my reaction on February 11 when the initial allegation on SLJ appeared. I woke up to a text from a friend and panicked. I reacted out of anger and anxiety. I lashed out and that was the worst possible thing I could have done. In that moment, I became a part of the culture I have fought against and, twenty-four years ago, was a victim of. Words aren't an adequate enough apology for my actions that day, but I'm deeply sorry for my public reaction. I should have stayed silent and let things play out on their own. Perhaps there would've been a different outcome. Perhaps not. In any case, I can't undo what I did, but I can apologize and, with work, learn from it.

I also owe a direct apology to Heidi Heilig, who was merely relaying names as they appeared in the article. Heidi and I have had our personal differences in the past, and I reacted from that place instead of taking a step back. I'm sorry for basically leaping down your throat, Heidi, and causing you any sort of panic or anxiety that day because of it. 

To the five women I reached out to via text that same day as well, I'm sorry. In my panic and fear, I was reaching out for comfort from friends and did not consider how it would appear or be received. I was merely thinking of myself in that moment and not thinking of how it would look. I should have left you alone to come to me if you chose to do so on your own. I'm sorry for the unease, anxiety, and hurt I caused you that day. 

**The SLJ Allegation**

For the past eleven days I've been going over and over my time at BEA in 2017, trying to make sense of the claim put forth in the comments of the SLJ article. Firstly, I've only ever been to BEA/Bookcon in 2017. It's the only conference I've ever been to. For those who want to call them separate conferences, yes; however, they take place back to back over the same four-day period, in the same convention center in NYC, and very little changes between the two (at least from my standpoint, but I was only there for my two signings and one day of wandering hoping to meet a few authors I admired). It felt like the same conference, and as far as travel and my receipts are concerned, it was one conference. 

The claim puts forth that during my "appearances on the conference circuit" I began sexually harassing this person and continued for over a year to a point they changed their entire social media identity to get away from me. 

I have no idea who this person is, and, at this point, I have nothing to lose anymore from continuing to deny it. I didn't have multiple appearances on the conference circuit. That was always easily disprovable. 

My time at BEA was spent overwhelmed with the stress and awe of being a debut author at their first signing in a completely unfamiliar city. This was also roughly three months before my hip surgery to repair a significant labral tear, but I didn't know it at the time. I was still fighting with my insurance to get an MRI to confirm my physical therapist's tentative diagnosis. I ended up spending too much money on Lyfts because walking to and from the train stations ended up being excruciating. While in NYC, I stayed with Libba Bray at her house and, other than a library event on Wednesday night with Nicole Brinkley (at which I knew very few people and ended up sitting on the floor in the back of a room with Elyse Springer), a brief wander around the BEA floor on Thursday to get my bearings, my signing on Friday followed by a viewing of Waitress with Nita Tyndall, and my signing on Sunday, I spent the entire time at Libba's house either working or resting because of my significant pain. In fact, she and I spent all of Saturday at her kitchen table while she worked on line edits and I worked on a short story.

I honestly don't know what else to say about this. I certainly didn't approach anyone in that fashion. My time was consumed with anxiety over my first public appearance as an author and trying to manage my chronic pain (and failing to do so spectacularly as I wasn't used to the level of physical activity the entire trip required). I also had a short story due, so I was stressing out about that as well.

**Preying on Teens**

This one is harder to address because I still don't quite know _exactly_ what it is I'm accused of in this arena. Over the past week and a half, I've seen everything from "Tristina craftily cultivated an environment within the YA community so she could prey on teenagers" to "Tristina cruelly manipulated the entire YA community for years so she could groom teenagers" to "Tristina used her advocacy for the queer community and the disability community as a front so she could prey on teenagers" to "Tristina treated teenagers as peers and that's wrong" to "Tristina has boundary problems with everyone."

I want to make something extremely clear. I have never sexually approached or harassed or groomed anyone, much less a teenager or any minor. Period. I will stand by this statement. And my advocacy was never a front for anything.

I do not know what it was that I said or did that caused any of the above statements. That said, it is apparent there are people, especially teens, who feel unsure about me and unsafe around me. For that, I am sorry. Whatever I said or did to make you feel that way, I sincerely apologize. I have always said intent does not equal impact, and what I may have said in complete passing in an old conversation I am no longer remembering hurt some of you. I have to own that and accept that I may never know the details. 

**The Weezie Discussion**

This is something I probably should have addressed in some fashion last year when it went down, but I didn't for multiple reasons - the very least being I'm a white author and Weezie is an indigenous blogger and there are multiple power imbalances there. At the time, I felt staying quiet about it was the best course of action. I don't know if I should have said something at the time. I understand some teens have come forward in recent days regarding harassment they've been subjected to, and part of me wonders if I should have said something earlier. The reason I'm including this here now is because, as I understand it, Weezie has been put forth as a second person naming me as an abuser, and I feel it's time to break my silence concerning this.

I became acquainted with Weezie through my friend Leah Karge. Leah and I have been friends for many years. We met on Tumblr in another fandom as fanfic writers. When I returned to Twitter as a professional author, I encouraged Leah to become more active in the Twitter book community. They did, and some time after that, they became friends with Weezie. That was the extent of my acquaintance with Weezie. 

Without going into detail because it's not my story to tell, Weezie and Leah's friendship fell apart and there was hurt involved. In the following weeks, I ended up muting Weezie on Twitter for personal reasons related to what happened between Weezie and Leah and for no other reason than that. I was supporting a close friend who was hurting and, at the time, muting was the best course of action. This was all well before my book was published, and, to be completely honest, once things between the two of them settled, I stopped thinking of Weezie entirely.

After Aimal's review of my book released, I received a text saying Weezie was accusing me of ignoring PoC attempting to contact me regarding the issues put forth regarding my book. Since I had them muted, I went to Weezie's timeline to make sure they hadn't directed this accusation at me (i.e. tagged me in it) because my rule during that time period was to only respond to people tagging me directly in any discussions/questions of my book. Any conversations regarding the issues in my book that did not directly tag me were not mine to participate in. I hadn't been invited. Weezie hadn't tagged me directly in this accusation, so I left it alone and didn't respond. I assumed it was something easily researched by viewing my mentions at the time to see who I was responding to. 

Instead, I went to a group chat with friends I thought I could trust and vented privately about my frustrations regarding the incident instead of lashing out publicly (hey, if only I'd carried that sentiment over, right?). One of them relayed what I said (or part of what I said) to Weezie directly, which resulted in Weezie blocking me and, according to someone who could see their timeline, insisting I was harassing them. My only regret during that incident was saying anything in that chat. I don't know if that was the catalyst for what happened afterward but, looking back, it feels like a tipping point. 

Anyway, from my perspective, once someone blocks me, that's it. I'm done. That's a definite boundary that I will respect, and I continued on with everything else leading up to the release of my book. 

A few weeks later (I don't remember the exact date), I received a text saying Weezie had posted an anon hate message sent to them on my behalf - either a reader/follower of mine or someone just trying to stir up shit. I asked if they would send me a screenshot of just the message so I could address it. I don't remember exactly what it said, but it was nasty. I immediately posted it to my own Twitter and said it was unacceptable. That I didn't care who sent it or why, but defending me like that was not something I wanted or appreciated and attacking anyone on my behalf was not something I would tolerate. Looking back, perhaps I should have reached out privately to Weezie to make sure they were okay, but at the time I assumed they didn't want to hear from me. 

This happened at least two more times, if my memory serves, the messages growing in vitriol. The last message is the one that Weezie brings up repeatedly. It was sent while their dad was undergoing surgery and it said the message writer hoped Weezie's dad died during surgery. Which is astonishingly horrific, no matter anyone's personal feelings toward anyone else over anything. Again, as I had with the others, I said something publicly. 

It wasn't until much later I learned Weezie believed it was me who sent the messages after someone suggested it was me to them, and then later claimed they had my IP address to prove it. Which isn't possible. Because I didn't send them. 

I'm not obsessed with Weezie, despite them thinking I am. I honestly never thought about them beyond the minor venting I did when they lied about how I was responding to people. And when they blocked me, that was it in my mind. I went about my own business. Honestly, I was done with them when I muted them far earlier for my own personal reasons regarding my friend. 

So, I'm not entirely certain where these claims of abuse and harassment come from because, for a very long time, there has been a definitive wall between Weezie and myself that has never had anything to do with my book or my writing, but simply me muting someone on the internet I barely knew so I wouldn't see them on my timeline anymore because my best friend was hurting. 

Perhaps I should've told this story earlier, but as I said before, there were roles at play. Author and Blogger. I didn't want to look like an author attacking a blogger, so I stayed silent. And if my silence in any way contributed to the hurt Weezie caused other people, I'm so sorry I didn't speak up sooner. 

**Conclusions…The Future**

I want to thank the editors of TOIL & TROUBLE for reaching out to me and discussing the best options for everyone involved in order for the anthology to succeed. I do appreciate that. The fact of the matter is, some people will believe me, and some people won't. And the people who don't will not buy anything with my name attached to it right now, which would hurt the other authors in the anthology unfairly. 

As far as Entangled Publishing is concerned, I can't speak on their decision for a myriad of reasons beyond my own hurt and disappointment. However, I would please ask friends, family, and any readers to not go after them on my behalf. They were well within their right to make the decision they did, and I respect that. 

I don't know what will happen to The Nightside Saga, or if I will ever revisit the world and finish the story. Things are too raw right now to consider it. However, if anyone would like to know how it all ended, feel free to email me and I'll tell you. I owe you at least that much.

I also have no idea what's going to happen with me publishing-wise. I have a lot of things to think about. There were a lot of things I read over the past eleven days from the mouths of people I once considered friends that simultaneously cut me deep and made me think. There is a lot of hurt and shattered trust right now. 

I want to keep writing. There are people in publishing who I wanted to work with. Maybe someday, that will once again be possible. As I said before, there are those who will believe me, and there are those who won't. I have no control over that outcome beyond telling my side of things and letting things fall where they will.

For now, this is goodbye. I stand by my innocence regarding these specific allegations; however, I'm sorry for the hurt I caused to my friends and to the teens I spectacularly failed.
