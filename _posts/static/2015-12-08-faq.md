I’ve compiled some of the most frequently asked questions (eh? see what I did there?) and put them here for your enjoyment. When in doubt, holler at me.



### What genres/categories do you write?

Anything that pops into my head really. My stories tend to have a heavy romantic lean to them because kissing brings me great joy. But I’ve written everything from romance to horror to gothic to fantasy. I don’t want to really restrict myself because there are millions of stories to be told. I do focus on queer characters because I believe that everyone, no matter what, should be able to open a book and see themselves as the lead.



### Who represents you?

The fabulous [Danielle Chiotti of Upstart Crow Literary](http://upstartcrowliterary.com/index.html). She’s amazing with an extra heaping of sauce. She gets me. Like really gets me and my writing, which is essential in an agent/author relationship. She’s totally in my corner and knows all the ins and outs of this business. All I have to do is write.



### Do you think she’d represent me too?

I don’t know! You can query her via her submission guidelines which can be found on Upstart Crow’s website. But I do ask that you not use me as a reference unless we’ve previously discussed it and I’ve said yes. Let your work stand on its own two feet. I’m really not that big of a deal.



### I wrote a book!

Congratulations!



### Will you read my work?

Do you know how much I would love to read the writing of each and every person on the face of the planet? I love words. However, I have an established group of critique partners and beta readers and, combined with their words and me needing to write more of my words, I simply don’t have the time. But there are amazing writing communities on twitter, tumblr, and facebook, and I can pretty much guarantee you someone is looking for a critique partner or a beta reader at any given time.



### Where can I buy your books?

You can find all information on my writing [here](/words/)!



### Your hair is amazing.

*beams* Thanks!



### Cake or Pie?

Cake. Clearly.



### I really want to get published. Any advice?

The best advice I can give you is there is no one golden piece of advice. Write your butt off. Query until it burns. Or self-publish and self-promote. Surround yourself with other writers. Live your life because that’s your greatest source of words. Be respectful, but don’t ever lose your sense of self. And have fun with it. Don’t ever forget that you’re a storyteller. You’re related to a vast and varied group of people who told stories around campfires and inspired imaginations of children. It’s an amazing profession and, above all, FUN.



### You have 10 chocolate bars and I took away 2. How many do you have left?

You’re really going to try to take my chocolate?



### Who’s your favorite author?

Well, that’s an impossible question to answer. Picking out one shining author above the rest is like asking me which of my children is my favorite. Every author I’ve read has provided something different – escape, entertainment, inspiration, feelings, research, etc. Hit me up if you’re looking for someone specific.



### That was a cop out answer.

*eyebrow*



### You write full time AND take care of kids?

Yes! I also make a mean grilled peanut butter and honey.



### What’s your favorite Christmas movie?

Die Hard



### Do you pants or plot? Do you come up with story or characters first?

My writing style changes with every book. Some books I’ve pantsed 100%. Some I’ve done half and half. Some I’ve plotted out from page one. However, the one constant is that I always think of characters first. My characters are very real, borderline imaginary friends. I talk to them, carry on conversations with them. They tell me their stories, and I write them down.



### Will you marry me?

My amazing hottie of a husband beat you to the punch, but I’m flattered. Really.
